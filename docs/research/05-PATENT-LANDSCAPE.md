# Patent Landscape Report: Biophotonics & UPE Detection
**Generated:** February 11, 2026

---

## Executive Summary
The biophotonics patent landscape is active but HelioFlux's specific application (UPE for cancer detection in clinical settings) appears to have limited direct competition. Key research dates back 40+ years, but clinical device patents are more recent.

## BIOPHOTONICS PATENT OVERVIEW

### US Leadership
- United States leads globally in biophotonics patents
- Also leads in funding, startup activity, commercial innovation
- Key patent holders are mostly large equipment companies

### Major Patent Holders
1. **Hamamatsu Photonics** — Sensors, detectors
2. **Thermo Fisher Scientific** — Lab equipment
3. **Danaher Corp** — Life sciences tools
4. **Carl Zeiss** — Optical systems
5. **Olympus** — Imaging systems

**Note:** These companies focus on RESEARCH equipment, not clinical diagnostic devices.

## UPE/BIOPHOTON RESEARCH HISTORY

### Key Papers & Prior Art

**Takeda et al. (2004)** — Cancer Science
- "Biophoton detection as a novel technique for cancer imaging"
- Demonstrated cancer cells emit different photon patterns
- Foundational research for the field

**Popp, Fritz-Albert** — Pioneer
- German researcher, foundational biophoton work
- Theorized cellular coherence via biophotons
- Work highly influential but not fully validated experimentally

**Recent PMC Research (2020)**
- "Ultraweak Photon Emissions as a Non-Invasive, Early-Malignancy Detection Tool"
- In vitro and in vivo study
- Validates UPE differences between cancer/non-cancer cells

## COMPETITIVE PATENTS TO MONITOR

### DermaSensor Patents
- Elastic scattering spectroscopy methods
- AI analysis algorithms
- Device design patents
- **Different technology than UPE**

### Liquid Biopsy Patents
- ctDNA detection methods
- Sample processing
- **Not directly competitive (different approach)**

## HELIOFLUX PATENT STRATEGY

### Current Status
- **Provisional patent filing in progress** with Mike Schaldenbrand (Strong Force)
- Need to file full patent within 12 months of provisional

### What to Protect
1. **Sensor array design** — Clinical-optimized UPE detection
2. **AI/ML algorithms** — Pattern recognition for anomalies
3. **Clinical workflow** — Integration into care pathway
4. **Specific wavelength findings** — Detection signatures

### Freedom to Operate
- UPE emission is a natural phenomenon (not patentable)
- Detection METHODS and DEVICES are patentable
- AI analysis approaches are patentable
- Clinical applications are patentable

---

## KEY RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS

### Active in UPE Research
- **Albert Einstein College of Medicine** — Kelly's former institution
- **Various Japanese universities** — Following Takeda's work
- **European research centers** — Popp's lineage

### Potential Prior Art Concerns
- Check academic publications from these institutions
- Ensure claims don't overlap with published methods
- May need licensing for certain foundational IP

---

## INTERNATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Key Markets
1. **United States** — Primary market, must have US patents
2. **Europe** — Second market, consider EPO filing
3. **Canada** — Nirosha's research base
4. **Japan** — Strong biophotonics market

### PCT Filing
- Consider Patent Cooperation Treaty filing for international coverage
- 30-month window from priority date
- Cost: $10-15K+ for full international

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (This Quarter)
1. ✅ Complete provisional filing (in progress)
2. Document all novel aspects of technology
3. Search for blocking patents in clinical UPE space

### Near-Term (6 months)
1. File full utility patent before provisional expires
2. Consider continuation patents for additional claims
3. Freedom-to-operate analysis

### Long-Term
1. Build patent portfolio around core technology
2. Consider design patents for device form factor
3. International filings in key markets
