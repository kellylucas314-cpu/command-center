**For HelioFlux:**

1. **Timing is perfect** — he's new, hungry for deals
2. **Lead with product** — UX, distribution, go-to-market
3. **Frame as "weird and wonderful"** — what others miss
4. **Emphasize operator cred** — he respects builders
5. **Data first** — show him the metrics

**Opening line idea:**
> "We're the 'weird and wonderful' in cancer diagnostics — 100x earlier detection with consumer-grade simplicity."
