Greg's 10-rule framework: (1) write everything in markdown, (2) link notes to mirror how your brain thinks, (3) let Claude Code read the vault + relationships, (4) use reference files instead of re-explaining context, (5) build custom slash commands (/context, /trace, /connect, /ideas, /graduate), (6) human writes the vault \u2014 agents read + execute, (7) surface unconscious patterns, (8) delegate from inside notes, (9) treat writing as leverage, (10) markdown files are the oxygen of LLMs. Key insight: 'Once the vault exists, the agent stops being generic. It starts thinking in your voice.' HIGHLY relevant \u2014 Kelly already has this system with Kip + markdown workspace. Next step: explore Obsidian CLI integration and custom slash commands.",
